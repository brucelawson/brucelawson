<h1>Version 2.3 "Non-Euclidian Dromedary"</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed clean-up bug in new Titles module</li>
	<li>New Titles module to show missing titles on iframes, and superlouous titles on other things to placate the false god of Search Engine Optimists</li>
	<li>Correct calculation of contrast ratio in the contrast module to take account of boldness of text and not just rely on height. (Thanks Mozilla dev tools!)</li>
	<li>New module to highlight empty elements, eg heading and paragrapsh, which was a constant bugbear on US marketing site</li>
	<li>Tweaked img/alt module to ask users to check accuracy of alt text (rather than perhaps falsely-reassure that presence of alt text is actually useful)</li>
	<li>New module to expose HTML5 landmarks (footer, header etc) and explicitly set ARIA roles (but not those that are implicit, because that's not as useful for diagnosing coder errors)</li>
	<li>Tweaked name and description module to stop referring to 'screen readers'; added exposure of value attribute on <code>input type=submit</code> fields (as that is what gets exposed and wasn't being reported). Add value of <code>aria-describedby</code> attributes as that is also passed to AT, especially as <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/12/using-aria-describedby-to-provide-helpful-form-hints/">hints/ instructions on form fields</a></li>
